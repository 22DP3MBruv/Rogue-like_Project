# Rogue-like_Project
A game to be made on godot which is inspired by the game "Vampire Survivors"

The game will be on a 2d flat plane with horizontal and vertical movements with simple ai enemies that try to defeat you with all sorts of means. I believe the game aesthetics will be pretty simple as im not much of a artist so the look of the plane and sprites will be pretty rudimentary. In the process of progressing through the game you will gain exp and level up at which you'll gain unique power ups that can change the way you play, at the same time the quantities and power of enemies will increase with the time progression making gameplay more difficult.
I hope to add a variation of attack types and projectiles that would make the game more interesting and gripping in the long run. The main objective in the game would be to complete stages with different difficulties that progressively become harder to beat.

The controls will be the classic ASDW movement keys and a mouse targeted attack method (some attack methods would be targeted and some be aura type attacks)
